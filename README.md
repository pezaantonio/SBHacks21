# SBHacks21

Language: Python

Purpose: This project was a submission for the SBHacks Hackathon 2021. We built an application to return surf conditions received from the MagicSeaweed API. We were unable to receive an API key from MagicSeaweed, but we were given a test JSON file we could use to further develop our application.

We chose to use the application 'Discord' as our front end. Users in our surf server could submit commands via the chat, and the bot would reply with the surf conditions
